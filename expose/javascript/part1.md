1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. The code returns an error on line 13 because the variable **result** is declared with keyword let, and therefore only can be accessed within the block of the if-statement where it was declared. 
5. The code returns an error and does not print anything out for line 9 because **result** was declared with the keyword const, so it can not be reassigned though we attempt to reassign it on line 7.
6. Similiar to the explanation to number 5, the code returns an error and will not print out anything for line 13 because **result** was declared with const and can not be reassigned, though we attempt to reassign it on line 7.
